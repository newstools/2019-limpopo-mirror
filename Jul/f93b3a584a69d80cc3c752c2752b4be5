The opening Premier Soccer League fixtures for the coming season will be played over the weekend of 3 and 4 August. Just like last season, Black Leopards will commence their league programme with a Limpopo derby. They will host Polokwane City at the Thohoyandou Stadium on Sunday, 4 August. Although it was their home fixture, Lidoda Duvha were forced to forfeit their home-ground advantage in their opening fixture last season. They were made to travel to Polokwane because of the renovations at the Thohoyandou Stadium that were in progress at that stage. Although they played away from home, Leopards managed to collect the maximum after beating City 1-0. Karabo Tshepe scored Leopards’ all-important goal from a free kick to ensure that the Thohoyandou side commenced the season with a bang. On the 4th, the new Leopards’ technical staff will guide the team in a league game for the first time. Mr Lionel Soccoia was appointed the team’s head coach two weeks ago. He will be assisted by the former Kaizer Chiefs player, Mr Patrick Mabedi, while Mr Mlungisi Ngubane is the new team manager. The club’s new signees, Thuso Phala, Thabo Matlaba, Mumuni Abubakar and Mogakolodi Ngele, are expected to be put to the test on that day. In the other matches that will also be played on 4 August, Highlands Park will host Kaizer Chiefs at the Makhulong Stadium in Thembisa. The KZN derby between Lamontville Golden Arrows and Maritzburg United will be staged at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium in Durban. The newly promoted Stellenbosch FC will entertain Chippa United at the Coetzenburg Stadium in Stellenbosch on Saturday, 3 August. Mamelodi Sundowns and SuperSport United will meet in their Pretoria derby at the Lucas Moripe Stadium. Baroka FC and Cape Town City will clash at the Peter Mokaba Stadium, while Orlando Pirates and Bloemfontein Celtic will meet at the Orlando Stadium.
