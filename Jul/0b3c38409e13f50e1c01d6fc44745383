The Sasol Women’s League game between Shayandima Morning Stars and Tshandama Young Stars at the Shayandima School grounds on Saturday was not played to the finish. Morning Stars were leading 2-0 when the game ended abruptly in the 26th minute. To prove that Young Stars’ house was not in order, they started the game with only seven players. That gave the home side enough chances to dictate terms in the middle of the park. Realizing that it would be difficult for them to find the net under those circumstances, Young Stars packed themselves at the back, with the hope that it would be possible for them to hold the hosts to a goalless draw. Unfortunately for them, that was not to be. Morning Stars opened their account in the ninth minute. Their bulldozer striker, Tshifhiwa Khangale, forced her way through the defence of Young Stars and hit the back of the net. Although they had nothing to defend, Young Stars continued to play defensive football even after conceding the first goal. Morning Stars took 18 minutes to increase the margin. They were awarded a corner kick after a defender of Young Stars fumbled in clearing the ball from danger and finally opted for a pass back to the keeper. The keeper failed to deal with the pass and thus caused a corner kick. Livhuwani Mukwevho hooked the ball in after a scramble within the box. Arinao Mudzielwana, the Young Stars’ centre back, sustained injury after colliding head-on with an opponent. She was taken to the nearby clinic for medical attention. Young Stars were then left with six players on the field. In terms of the league’s rules and regulations, a team can be allowed to play a game with a minimum of seven players on the field. The referee, Ms Unarine Nembaleni, then blew the final whistle. Safa Limpopo’s general secretary, Mr Patrick Seema, said that he was still waiting for match reports from the clubs and match officials at the time of our going to press.
