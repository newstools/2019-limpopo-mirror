The struggle for promotion and to escape the relegation axe will continue among the teams affiliated to the Limpopo Stream of the Sasol Women’s League this weekend. All matches will be played at various venues throughout the province tomorrow (Saturday) afternoon. All eyes will be on the match between Shayandima Morning Stars and Maindis Ladies. Maindis will enjoy home-ground advantage as the match will be played at the Ladanna grounds in Polokwane. The winner in tomorrow’s match is likely to be crowned league champions at the end of the season. Maindis are currently leading the pack, with Morning Stars in second position. Maindis are still in a celebratory mood after their 7-0 bashing of Tshandama Young Stars last Saturday. On the other hand, Shayandima Morning Stars also collected the maximum points after beating Samba Girls 1-0. Stars’ forwards, Maureen Morudi, Mmaleako Mojapelo and Tshifhiwa Khangale, will have a mammoth task to penetrate the defence of Maindis. Chippas United Ladies will host Sisters FC at the Tshifudi Stadium. Sisters must keep a watchful eye on the Chippas’ playmakers, Maggie Mukhuwana, Khodani Ratshalingwa and Thonifho Nengovhela, or they are in for a heavy defeat. Samba Girls will travel to Mabalane village in the Giyani area for their match against Real Mighty Girls will be played. Samba Girls must win the match in order to move out of the relegation zone. They are currently in the second-last position on the log, with Tshandama Young Stars languishing at the bottom. The Samba Girls will rely on Madembe Tshikumbu, Dolly Mnisi and Murembiwa “Mdu” Mugivhi for goals. Tshandama Young Stars will visit Botlokwa Ladies at the Sefene High School grounds in Matoks. Young Stars are still to win a league match to date.
