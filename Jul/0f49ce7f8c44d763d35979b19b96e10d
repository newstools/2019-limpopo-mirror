Edson Muraida from Siloam Village in the Nzhelele Valley fought hard to earn a 2-1 victory over Ngovhela XI Experience in the final of the Mukhombo Soccer Tournament at the Lwamondo Zwavhavhili grounds on Sunday. Muraida meant business from the first whistle, with their midfielders distributing some telling passes to the forwards time after time. The referee, Ms Vhahangwele Nembaleni, flashed the first yellow card in the 14th minute. Mashau Ramulondi of XI Experience tackled Rudzani Nthangeni from behind and Nembaleni was quick to produce yellow. No goal was scored in the first half, despite numerous promises by the strikers of Muraida. XI Experience strengthened their midfield by introducing Tshifhiwa “Gama” Ramatsea and sacrificed Aubrey Mabukana early in the last half. Muraida took the lead in the 59th minute. They were awarded a penalty after a defender of XI Experience handled the ball within his own penalty area. Omphulusa Ndou, the team’s captain, made no mistake from the white spot. XI Experience lost shape in the middle of the park after the opening goal of Muraida. A substitute, Thingahangwi Ratombo, tried his luck with a long-range ground cutter. The ball hit the woodwork and crossed the goal line. XI Experience effected two more changes to their starting line-up soon afterwards. They replaced Fhatuwani Netshivhambe and Jabulani Mashatha with Unarine Matamela and Andani Nenzhelele respectively. XI Experience pulled one back on the stroke of full time. Thendo Mathobo caught the keeper napping with a long-range half volley. Muraida received R3 500 and a floating trophy after the game.
