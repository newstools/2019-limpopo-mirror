If the current league log for the GladAfrica Championship were the final one, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) would be gaining automatic promotion to the Absa Premiership Division. TTM are shining on top of the log with seven points accumulated from the three matches they have played to date. The Tshakhuma side moved to the top of the log, following their 3-0 victory over Swallows FC at the Thohoyandou Stadium last Saturday. The rookies, JDR Stars, dropped to the second spot on the log, two points behind TTM. The other teams that have five points in their league account are Richards Bay FC and University of Pretoria. Asked to comment shortly after their impressive 3-0 victory over Swallows FC, Mr Momcilo Medic, the team’s head coach, warned his players not to fall into the trap of becoming complacent and relaxing as if the league programme were over. He reiterated the fact that the league programme is a marathon that stretches over a period of 10 months. He further stated that the most important aspect for him was to motivate the players to maintain their current form and never to look back. He said that they would use the 10-day break to tighten up their loose ends. TTM displayed entertaining football throughout the game, but they could not find the net in the first half, despite numerous close-range attempts. Their opening goal came nine minutes into the last stanza. Thembisani Nevhulamba forced his way through the defence of Swallows and beat the keeper. TTM replaced Onyedikachi Ononogbu with Wisani Mandlazi. Mboniseni Mbandlwa, TTM’s dribbling wizard, was brought down within the box. That was a clear penalty for the home side. Jean Munganga, the team’s captain, took the responsibility and converted from the penalty spot. A substitute, Naeem Amoojee, made his presence felt when his second touch of the ball gave rise to TTM’s third goal in the dying minutes of the game. Amoojee gave the ball the final touch, following a square pass from Tumisang Mashele.
