Tshikota High showed character and determination during the national Kay Motsepe U/19 tournament that was played in Bloemfontein last week. They ended in fifth position and came back with R100 000 in prize money. The school ended in second spot in the group, tied with the top school, Siphokuhle High from Mpumalanga. Both teams ended with 10 points, winning three of their matches and drawing one. Unfortunately for the Vhembe team, they lost on goal difference. The coach of the school, Mr Justice Matloga, said that his boys had played well in the tournament but had been overexcited at stages. He is proud that they did not lose a match in the contest. He expressed his joy with the school’s performances this year. He regards them as unfortunate not to have gone through to the final rounds, but he believes next year they will be able to do even better. Matloga said that the team had received tremendous support from the principal and teachers. The chairperson of school football in Vhembe, Mr Scara Tshigomana, congratulated the team and emphasised the importance of sports in the lives of young people. He said that sports provided many positive opportunities for school children. “Good sportsmanship provides guidelines that can be used in life. It also teaches children to function in a competitive society.”
