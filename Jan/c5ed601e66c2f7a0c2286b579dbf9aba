The chairperson of Contralesa in Vhembe, Hosi Gulukhulu Prince Mathebula, has urged all residents make use of the last days of voter registration (26 and 27 January) and to register at their place of residence. Mathebula spoke during a meeting with the leadership of the ANC in Vhembe last weekend. Before meeting, the ANC leadership - the executive - first met the leadership of the Communist Party, where several issues, including unity, were deliberated on. Speaking during the meetings, Mathebula said organizations and traditional leaders needed each other. "We should not renew our relationship during elections only. We should work together for the benefit of our communities. We know organizations have members, but their members are our people and as such we should work as one.‚Äù He further urged residents to desist from damaging resources such as schools when they had grievances, but to sit down and iron out their problems. He further indicated that service delivery protests should not infringe on the education of children as it would hamper their progress.
