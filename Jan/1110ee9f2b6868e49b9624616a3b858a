A well-known boxer, Mr Balangani Ndou (35) of Nweli, was killed in a freak accident after the tree he chopped down allegedly fell on him. The incident took place at the Thohoyandou (Matatshe) Correctional CentreÂ on Sunday. The family is now becoming very impatient and is urging the police to supply information regarding the incident. The spokesperson for Correctional Services, Ms Tshidi Mapole, stated that a thunderstorm had uprooted a tree on Sunday, and it had fallen on three official vehicles. They immediately appointed a private company to cut down other trees that were growing next to the fence. Ndou was apparently hired by the private company and was killed while they were cutting down one of the trees. Brig Motlafela Mojapelo of the SAPS confirmed that the police had opened an inquest docket after a tree had fallen on a man. The boxing match maker, Azwinndini Simba, said that the boxing fraternity was shocked when they heard the sad news and sent their condolences to the family. Ndou will be buried at Nweli on Saturday. The service will start at 06:00. He is survived by his wife and four children.
