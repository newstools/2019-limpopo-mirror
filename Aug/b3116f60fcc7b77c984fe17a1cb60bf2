Young netball players from Tshikota are bubbling with joy after they received a netball kit from the Collins Sebola Group. The Girls are a youth-development netball team that was started early last year. Some of their challenges included a lack of netball kit. They are an excellent netball team who had won several matches, but the fact that they had no proper netball kit had always demoralised them. “We are very excited after receiving the netball kit from Mr Collins Sebola,” said the netball team's manager, Mr Lucky Mabasa. “Our team is largely made up of young school-going girls and the fact that they belong to and participate in the activities of the team is also a reward for them in that they are left with less time to roam the streets.” Sebola said that he had a lot of interest in the needs of the youth within the community. “We are only glad that the netball kit went to a team of young women who deserve it most,” he said. “We told them to make good use of the netball kit. We donated to them because we wanted to add value to the kind of sporting activity they are involved in.”
