Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) have managed to retain the team’s left back, Lebohang Mabotja. Mabotja joined the Tshakhuma side early last season. According to the club’s chairman, Mr Humbulani Mphephu, the highly talented left back was reluctant to extend his contract with the club when it expired at the end of last season. According to Mphephu, Mabotja told them that he wanted to try his luck with the Premiership League clubs before he would consider extending his contract with Vhadau Vha Damani. His last throw of the dice was with Bloemfontein Celtics, with whom he trained for about two weeks. Only after Celtic told him that they were not interested in employing him did Mabotja decide to go back to TTM last Thursday. “Mabotja is back in the camp and our search for a natural left back is now something of the past,” said Mphephu. He said that players of Mabotja’s calibre were very scarce and that they were very happy to retain his services for another season. He further stated that Mabotja was a utility player who had a share in many a goal the team scored last season, even though he was a defender. Mabotja is expected to form a good combination with Carlington Nyadombo, Tshepo Makgoga, Jean Munganga and Karabo Mofokeng at the team’s backline. Mphephu also mentioned that Mabotja would have enough time to familiarize with his teammates before the activities for the new season started in two weeks’ time. Mabotja played for Black Leopards for several years before moving to TTM at the beginning of last season. TTM will play against Cape Umoya United in their opening league match at the Thohoyandou Stadium on Sunday, 17 August.
