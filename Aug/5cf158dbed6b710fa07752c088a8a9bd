The opening matches of the Multichoice Diski Challenge League will be played at various venues this weekend. Black Leopards will play their first match in front of their home crowd. They will host Cape Town City at the Thohoyandou Stadium tomorrow (Saturday) at 10:00. Just like that of their elder brothers, Black Leopards’ performance was not impressive last season. They managed to win only three of the 14 matches they played, finishing their league programme in the third position from the bottom of the log. The team’s poor performance prompted the management of Lidoda Duvha to appoint Mr Mongezi Bobe as the head coach of the team. Bobe played for Black Leopards while they were still campaigning in the National First Division six years ago. The team was under the guidance of Mr Justice Matloga last season. In the other Diski Challenge matches that will also be played tomorrow, Maritzburg United will host SuperSport United at the King Zwelithini Stadium in Durban. That match will be followed by the one between Lamontville Golden Arrows and Kaizer Chiefs at the same venue. In the two matches that will be played on Sunday, Polokwane City will host Bidvest Wits at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium, and Highlands Park and Baroka FC will meet at the Makhulong Stadium in Thembisa. Three matches will be played today (Friday). The newcomers, Stellenbosch FC, will take on Chippa United at the Idas Valley Stadium in Stellenbosch. A double header will be staged at the King Zwelithini Stadium in Durban. Bloemfontein Celtic will meet Mamelodi Sundowns at 10:00, followed by the match between Amazulu and Orlando Pirates.
