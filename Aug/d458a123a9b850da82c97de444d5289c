After losing their first two league matches, the Multichoice Diski Black Leopards have another mountain to climb this weekend. They will fight for league points against Stellenbosch FC at the Thohoyandou Stadium on Sunday morning. Just like their elder brothers, the Diski Leopards started the season on a miserable note with two defeats. They lost 0-2 to Cape Town City in front of their own home crowd in their opening match two weeks ago. The young Lidoda Duvha went on to donate points to Orlando Pirates when they lost 0-1 at the Rand Stadium in Johannesburg last Saturday. Asked to comment about the team’s poor performances in their first two league matches, the team’s head coach, Mr Mongezi Bobe, said there was nothing much to worry about. He stated that he would soon find a winning combination and bring smiles to the fans’ faces again. The game is scheduled to start at 10:00. In the other matches that will also be played tomorrow morning, Baroka FC will play against Maritzburg United at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane. Maritzburg lost 0-3 to Chippa United last Saturday. A double header will be staged at the Makhulong Stadium in Thembisa. Cape Town City and Chippa United will meet at 10:00, followed by the match against Bidvest Wits and Orlando Pirates. Polokwane City will lock horns with Highlands Park at the Makhulong Stadium on Sunday. Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns will meet at 12:00. Golden Arrows and SuperSport United will fight for league points at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium in Durban.
