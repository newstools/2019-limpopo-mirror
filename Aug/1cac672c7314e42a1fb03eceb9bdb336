Life virtually came to a standstill in Madombidzha on Sunday as scores of people gathered to pay their last tribute to a former police officer and soccer guru, Mr Solly Mashudu Mavhandu (61). Mavhandu died a fortnight ago at the Louis Trichardt Memorial hospital and was buried on Sunday. During the funeral ceremony, Mavhandu was described as a pioneer, a born leader and a man of vision. Mr Abbie Radzilani said the whole community gathered “with heavy hearts”, because Mavhandu was very influential in the area. Radzilani said the family and ZCC church members were in great pain after losing one of their beloved members. Mr Justice Matloga, representing the Greenway Soccer Academy, said the football family had lost one of its pillars, who had always been working hard towards the development of soccer. "The whole region was shocked when we heard of his untimely death." Mavhandu said that the deceased had not been participating in soccer for glory or money. A community member, Mr Parks Phathela, said the area had lost an icon in the soccer fraternity "who has made an enormous contribution in terms of developing and nurturing the talents of black people. We will remain celebrating his contribution of improving the lives of our people".
