Another busy weekend waits for the teams affiliated to the Multichoice Diski Challenge. Six matches will be played at different places tomorrow, while the remaining two will be played on Sunday. Mamelodi Sundowns are geared to continue from where they left off last weekend, when they crushed Kaizer Chiefs 3-0 at the Makhulong Stadium in Thembisa. Sundowns must win the match, no matter the cost, in order to remain in the hot race for the league title. They are currently in the second spot with seven points accumulated from three matches. Sundowns and the pace setters, SuperSport United, are only separated by goal difference. Maritzburg United will host Black Leopards at the Harry Gwala Stadium in Pietermaritzburg. Leopards collected their first league point last weekend, following their 3-3 draw with Stellenbosch FC in Thohoyandou. The coach of the junior Leopards, Mr Mongezi Bobe, promised the team’s fans nothing less than victory tomorrow, saying he had found the winning combination. Chippa United will host Amazulu in Port Elizabeth, while Polokwane City will pay a visit to Stellenbosch FC. The other Saturday fixtures are Bidvest Wits vs Kaizer Chiefs and Baroka FC vs SuperSport United. Sunday’s matches are Cape Town City vs Golden Arrows and Orlando Pirates vs Bloemfontein Celtic.
