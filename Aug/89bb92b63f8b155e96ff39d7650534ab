In their Thulamela Local Football Association League match at the Khubvi grounds on Saturday, Mudaswali United Brothers came back from a 0-1 half-time deficit to beat Makonde Young Tigers 3-1. Young Tigers did not spare any effort in the first half. They approached the game with a lot of self-confidence, with their defenders refusing to allow any stranger within their territory. The fact that the visitors from Makonde took the lead in the 18th minute came as no surprise. Their solitary goal came via their Rastafarian striker, Rabelani Tshikhotho. He forced his way through the Brothers’ defence and blasted in a rocket from inside the box. The game turned lukewarm towards the end of the first half as the teams sat back and played defensive football. United Brothers injected more life into their squad by introducing Livhuwani Ntsieni and Unarine Rambuda, who replaced Takalani Nkhanedzeni and Isani Mbevhana respectively. The replacements marked the turning point of the game. United Brothers found the equalizer in the 58th minute. Unarine Rammbuda hooked the ball in, following a scramble within the box. Lufuno Mulondo of Young Tigers was cautioned with a card after a continued argument with the referee. Another player who was reprimanded with a card was Ronewa Sadiki of United Brothers. He obstructed Mashudu Maswazi in the 67th minute. Shortly thereafter, United Brothers scored when Ronewa Sadiki went loose from the left corner and beat the keeper. Tigers started to press the panic button after the Brothers’ second goal. They abandoned their positions and moved forward in numbers. That made things easier for Brothers to score the third through Divhani Neduvhuledza late in the game.
