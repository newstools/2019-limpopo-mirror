In their Sasol Womenâ€™s League match at the Makhuvha Stadium on Saturday, Maindis Ladies brutally walloped Chippas United Ladies 5-1 to maintain their leadership on the log. Maindis approached the game aggressively, with their midfielders distributing some telling passes to the strikers time after time. It took them only seven minutes to stamp their authority. Linky Twala, their left winger, received a neat pass from Molepo Rapatsa from what looked like an offside position and blasted in a rocket from close range. Chippas lost shape in the middle of the park after conceding the first goal. That gave the visitors from Polokwane a good chance to increase the margin in the 18th minute. Molepo Rapatsa forced her way through the defence of Chippas and hit the back of the net with a powerful shot. The home side made a comeback towards the end of the first half. They pulled one back in the 34th minute. Lethabo Sello gave the ball the final touch after a scramble within the box to bring the half-time score to 2-1. In the 64th minute Maindis increased the margin. Tswarelo Mpuru made no mistake after a square pass from Rapatsa. Maindis scored their last two goals through Lebohang Ramalepe and Thembi Munyuku in the 69th and 74th minute respectively. Maindis were unlucky not to score more goals as Chippas were out of touch towards the end of the game.
