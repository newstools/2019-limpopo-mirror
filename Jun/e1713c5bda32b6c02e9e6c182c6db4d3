Madridtas FC secured a place in the semi-final stage of the MMK Administrators Soccer League promotional play-offs. They drew 1-1 with Ngovhela XI Experience in their opening group-stage match at the Makhuvha Stadium on Monday morning. They registered a 6-0 victory over Dipeni FC in their second match at the same venue that afternoon. The result against Dipeni was not a true reflection of the game as Madridtas were out of touch for the better part of the first half. As if they were going to bury their opponents alive, Dipeni took the game to Madridtas from the first whistle. They threatened to score in the fourth minute when their playmaker, Rudzani Thabo, forced his way through the defence of Madridtas and lost possession just before he could unleash from inside the box. The referee, Mr Calvin Nemavhola, flashed the first yellow card in the 24th minute. Muwakale Mavhungu of Madridtas was booked for obstructing Rudzani Thabo just outside the box. Madridtas took the lead two minutes into the last half. Edward Mabasa finished off Gift Nemutandani’s square pass. What followed thereafter was a one-way traffic flow, with Dipeni at the receiving end. Gift Nemutandani beat the offside trap and sent the keeper the wrong way. They put matters beyond doubt when Muwakale Mavhungu blasted in a rocket from close range in the 59th minute. Dipeni lost shape in the middle of the park after Madridtas’s third goal. Gift Nemutandani scored the fourth six minutes afterwards. Realizing that the opposition were down and out, Madridtas initiated numerous dangerous moves from behind with their midfielders dishing out some telling passes. Muwakale Mavhungu scored the last two goals towards the end of the game.
