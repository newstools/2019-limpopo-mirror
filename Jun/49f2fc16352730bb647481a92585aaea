It will be business as usual for the teams affiliated to the Limpopo Stream of the Sasol Women’s League. All matches will be played tomorrow afternoon. The match not to be missed will be between Samba Girls and Tshandama Young Stars at the Tshikombani Primary school grounds. Whether Young Stars will be able to rise to the occasion and register their first victory remains to be seen. They are still to win a league match this season. Their most recent result was 2-3 defeat at the hands of Sisters FC at the Tshandama grounds last Saturday. On the other hand, Samba Girls are not safe when it comes to relegation. They are in the second-last position on the log. Young Stars must find a way to neutralize the Girls’ playmakers, Murembiwa Mugivhi, Madembe Tshikumbu and Beauty Twala if they are serious about escaping relegation. The log leaders, Shayandima Morning Stars, will play in front of their home crowd. They will host Sisters FC at the Shayandima school grounds. Some of the Stars’ players who can cause havoc in the Sisters’ danger area, if not properly marked, include Maureen Morudi, Musiiwa Ramaremisa and Phuluso Mothelo. Chippas United Ladies will undertake a journey to Polokwane for their match against Re Tla Dira Ladies. Maindis Ladies will visit Botlokwa Ladies, while the newcomers, Fifty Stars Ladies, await the arrival of Mandebele Happy Fighters at the Marapong Stadium in Lephalale. The other fixtures are Kanatla Ladies vs Moria Sweepers, University of Limpopo vs Re Tla Dira Ladies and Seven Stars Ladies vs Skimzozo FC.
