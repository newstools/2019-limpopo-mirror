After failing to get promotion to the Absa Premiership through the promotional playoffs this season, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) are now aiming for automatic promotion next season. TTM finished their league programme in the third position on the log with 51 points, a position that qualified them to take part in the playoffs. The league champions, Stellenbosch FC, gained automatic promotion while TTM and Royal Eagles, who finished in the second spot, together with Maritzburg United, who finished in the 15th position in the Absa Premiership Division, took part in the playoffs. Maritzburg United won all four matches and retained their Absa Premiership franchise. On the other hand, TTM won only one of their four promotional playoff matches. According to the marketing manager of TTM, Mr Livhuwani Madzuhe, the management, together with the players and technical staff, had agreed that next season would be their turn to gain automatic promotion to the elite division. He stated that the team’s head coach, Mr Momcilo Medic, had given them his off-season programme before flying to his home country, Serbia, on Monday this week. Madzuhe revealed that Mr Medic will be back on Friday, 28 June, to start with the preparations for the new season. According to him, the team will resume with their training on 8 July. He further indicated that they will conduct trials for the new players in the first week of next month. The players who impress the coach during the trials will join the old team members the following week, Monday, 8 July. When asked about the players who had parted ways with the club at the end of the season, Madzuhe said that negotiations were taking place with some of the players whose contracts will expire at the end of this month. He revealed, however, some of the players who were regulars in last season’s squad who are still contracted to the club. Among them are Onyedikachi Ononogbu, Ndabayithethwa Ndlondlo, Nhlanhla Mgaga and Tshepo Makgoga.
