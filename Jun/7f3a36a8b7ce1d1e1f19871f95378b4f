After suffering a 0-6 drubbing at the hands of Madridtas FC in their opening MMK Administrators League promotional play-off match, Dipeni FC rectified their mistakes and crushed Ngovhela XI Experience 4-1 in their second match at the Makhuvha Stadium on Monday afternoon. Although no goal was scored in the first half, the teams managed to provide enough entertainment. Dipeni were unstoppable in the first 20 minutes of the game, but they found it difficult to beat the Experience defence. The scoreboard was still blank, even though Dipeni were throwing missiles from all angles. Experience approached the last half with more self-confidence. They took the lead after five minutes when Avhakholwi Khampha intercepted a back pass and beat the keeper with a close-range ground cutter. The goal seemed to be an insult to the Dipeni players. They regrouped from behind, pressing hard in their search for an equalizer. Their efforts paid dividends when they found the equalizer in the 59th minute. A defender of Experience handled within the box and the referee, Mr Fhulufhelo Masindi, awarded a penalty to Dipeni. Rotondwa Mutsivhuli made no mistake from the white spot. Dipeni took the lead moments thereafter. Rotondwa Mutsivhuli was on target again with a half volley. A substitute, Mashudu Nyadzani, made his presence felt when he scored the third goal after beating the offside trap in the 74th minute. Ngovhela lost hope after Dipeniâ€™s third goal and were lucky not to concede more than half a dozen of goals thereafter. Dipeni scored the fourth via Rotondwa Mutsivhuli later in the game. In the other promotional play-off match that was played at the Malamulele Stadium on the same day, Mpheni Home Defenders beat Muziafera Blue Eagles 1-0 to secure a place in the semi-final stage.
