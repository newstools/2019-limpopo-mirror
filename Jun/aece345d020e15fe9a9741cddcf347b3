Fundudzi United Brothers secured a place in the final of the MTG KO competition by beating Mukula Young Brothers 5-3 in their semi-final match at the Makonde Home Defenders grounds on Sunday. The game was evenly contested, with the teams creating and squandering their scoring chances. Young Brothers were the first to knock on the opposition's door. Their overlapping midfielder, Dakalo Masithi, was the first to cause an upset. He received a neat pass from Ndindedzo Rasalanavho and unleashed aimlessly from close range. The ball missed the target by inches, much to the fans’ disappointment. As if that was not good enough to annoy the fans, Mpho Musehane committed a similar blunder moments later. He received a beautiful pass from Livhuwani Ndou and tried his luck with a half volley from the 20-meter area. Musehane suffered the pain of watching the ball go astray. United Brothers used all their substitution chances in the last half. They replaced Khuthadzo Netshia, Pfarelo Netshidzati and Mphedziseni Nekokwane with Marvelous Ntsieni, Phuluso Nenzhelele and Khatha Tshililo respectively in the 64th minute. Young Brothers responded by introducing Ndovhatshinyani Tendamudzimu for Zwivhuya Maginya moments later. Young Brothers took the lead in the 74th minute. Their captain, Dakalo Masithi, beat the keeper with a ground cutter, following a square pass from Edzisani Tendamudzimu. Phuluso Nenzhelele scored the Young Brothers’ equalizer six minutes later. The game turned lukewarm in the last 10 minutes as the teams played defensive football. The score line was 1-1 at the end of the regulation time and the winner was determined through a penalty shootout. United Brothers converted four of their five chances through Mulaedza Rasuwa, Thabelo Ntshauba, Ndamulelo Muhashela and Awelani Mulaudzi, while Young Brothers scored only two from the white spot.
