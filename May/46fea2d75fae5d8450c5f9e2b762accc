The joy at the Thohoyandou Stadium after Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) beat Richards Bay FC 2-0 in their National First Division League match on Sunday could not have been greater than if they had won a cup final. The victory means that TTM secured a place in the promotional playoffs that are scheduled to kick off next Wednesday, 15 May. The Tshakhuma side finished their league programme in the third position on the log with 51 points, five behind the league champions, Stellenbosch FC. Stellenbosch gained automatic promotion to the Absa Premiership League Division and wrapped up their league programme with a goalless draw against Maccabi FC. The other NFD side that will join TTM in the promotional playoffs is Royal Eagles. TTM and Royal Eagles will know tomorrow afternoon which Premiership team is to join them in the promotional playoffs. The team that will finish in the second-last position in the Premiership Division will join TTM and Royal Eagles in the playoffs, while the last team on the log will be relegated to the lower division. The team that will be on top of the log at the end of the promotional playoffs will also be promoted to the Premiership Division. TTM will play their first promotional playoffs match away from home. They will undertake a journey to Pietermaritzburg, where they will lock horns with Royal Eagles at the Harry Gwala Stadium next Wednesday. They will wrap up their programme by paying a visit to the Absa Premiership Division side on Saturday, 1 June. Phumelele “Ace” Bhengu and Thembisani Nevhulamba scored the two goals for TTM against Richards Bay last Sunday. Meanwhile, the marketing manager of TTM, Mr Livhuwani Madzuhe, said that they had arranged transport for the fans to Pietermaritzburg next Wednesday. The transport fee is R200. Fans interested in joining the bus can phone Madzuhe on 071 672 9034 for more information.
