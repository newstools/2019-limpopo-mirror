The youth must make informed decisions, said a representative of Corner West Funerals, Mr Thinga Ralufhe, during the prize-giving ceremony of the Corner West Tournament at Tshiozwi on Sunday. Tshiozwi Dynamos emerged as the champions after beating Tshiozwi Mates 5-4 in the final. The teams played to goalless draw and the winner was determined via penalty shoot-out. Ralufhe stated that they would continue to sponsor sports and that it formed part of their mission. "It is our obligation to ensure that the society in which we are living is healthy and sponsoring participation in sport is a step in the right direction." He said that the aim of his company in funding sport was to develop rural young people, keep the youth off the streets and prevent them from abusing alcohol. He appealed to the youth to take their education seriously if they wanted to get somewhere in life. He said study was a process that required dedication, concentration and effective time management. According to Cllr Elisa Tambani, a nation without education is doomed and will not develop. "Let us help prepare our youth to be responsible members of society who can contribute positively to the development of our country,” she said. Vhamusanda Vho-Makhado Sinthumule praised Corner West Funerals for their involvement in school football. He stated that he was convinced that the sponsorship would produce big stars. The champions, Tshiozwi Dynamos, went home with R15 000 and the runners-up, Tshiozwi Mates with R500.
