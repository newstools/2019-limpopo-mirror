Following two successive defeats in their promotional playoff matches, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) are almost out of the promotion race. They lost 0-1 to Royal Eagles in their opening match at the Chatsworth Stadium in Durban last Wednesday and suffered a 0-2 blow at the hands of Maritzburg United at the Thohoyandou Stadium two days ago (Wednesday). In an interview with Mr Momcilo Medic, TTM’s head coach, after Wednesday’s game, he refused to admit that the Tshakhuma side are out of the promotion race, saying it was still possible, although not easy. He stated that his team’s performance against Maritzburg was far better than what they displayed against Royal Eagles. He reiterated the fact that they could have scored a goal or two from the few scoring chances they created, but it was not their day. He said that they are going to fight to the bitter end as anything is still possible. TTM will host Royal Eagles at the Thohoyandou Stadium tomorrow (Saturday) afternoon. They will wrap up their promotional playoff programme by undertaking a journey to Pietermaritzburg, where they will play against Maritzburg United at the Harry Gwala Stadium on Saturday, 1 June. The only way that will see TTM gain promotion is for them to win their remaining two matches with big margins and that Maritzburg United lose their match against Royal Eagles at the Chatsworth Stadium in Durban next Wednesday, 29 May. Speaking to a contingent of journalists after their victory against TTM on Wednesday, United’s head coach, Mr Eric Tinkler, said that their target is to win their match against Royal Eagles next Wednesday and then celebrate their retention of the Absa Premiership franchise. Should United win their match against Eagles, their last fixture against TTM will be a mere formality. A substitute, Judas Moseamedi, and Bandile Shandu scored for Maritzburg United against TTM towards the end of the game.
