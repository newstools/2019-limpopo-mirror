An author from Malamulele, Kgomotso Mandy Hlongwane, launched her first book, But God kept me, last week.

The 27-year-old said that the book is based on a true life story about a woman who was knocked down by life several times, but managed to rise up, dust herself off and continue with the journey by God's grace. "This book tells about the journey of a defiant woman, who stood against the odds that life threw at her by leaning only on God's grace to get through each dire moment. Learn from her sincere spirit and watch as your life transforms with each page. When you are down and out and about to throw in the towel, when you need a spirit injection of hope - this book is for you," she added. She said that she was inspired to write the book to give glory to God, â€œfor the way He works and how He is able to change a hopeless situation within the blink of an eye". She continued to say that she wanted to restore hope to people who felt as if life was no longer worth living because of the endless and impossible mountains they climbed every day, especially the youth. "Adulting can be a challenge, especially on the relationships side. I shared my story, which once made me lose hope in life, until God picked me up and made me realise that it was not yet over," she said. "My main aim is to know someone out there will get healing of the soul through this book, and so far I got good feedback from many and how it is helping them; that was the goal from the beginning," she said.

She studied for a diploma in nursing at the Limpopo College of Nursing. She describes herself as a strong woman of faith. "It's not over until God says it's over," she said.

The book was published by Flying Scroll Digital. She can be reached on 064 682 0072 or via Facebook as Kgomotso Mandy Hlongwane Nwasono.
