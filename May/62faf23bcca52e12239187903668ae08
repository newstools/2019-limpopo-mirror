A respected leader of the Holiness Christian Church (HCC), Pastor William Mbambale (99), was buried at Ravele on Saturday. He died at the Louis Trichardt Memorial Hospital last Tuesday after a long illness. Samsokolo, as he was affectionately known, was a respected and admired pastor and community leader. The packed tent at his house and interested people outside did not shed a tear as the family had requested that it be a celebration of a life well lived. Among the mourners were community members, relatives, friends and church members in their church regalia. Mr Sam Mbambale, a son of the pastor, described his death as a big loss to the family. "He was one of a kind, a unique person who was always ready to help every member of his family and whoever came to him for help. We have lost a great father," he added. Pastor Daniel Mammburu of the HCC said the family, community and church were in great pain after losing one of their beloved leaders. Mbambale is survived by his three children, 11 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren.
