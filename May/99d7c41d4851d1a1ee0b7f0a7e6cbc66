Mapate Black Mambas secured a place in the next round of the MTG KO competition by beating Dzwerani United Brothers 3-1 at the Tshisaulu Lwandani grounds on Sunday. United Brothers were unstoppable in the first 20 minutes of the game. They created numerous scoring chances at that stage, but finding their way through the defence of Mambas was difficult for them. Black Mambas recuperated with time and started to play attacking football towards the end of the first half. Oscar Ntshauba and Aubrey Mudau, the Brothers midfielders, were a thorn in the flesh to the opposition defence. Ntshauba played as a holding midfielder while Mudau overlapped at times to add to the number to his strikers. United Brothers were the first to open an account. Aubrey Mudau finished off a rebound, following Mukhethwa Muloiwa’s close-range attempt in the 29th minute. United Brothers enjoyed the 1-0 lead until the referee, Mr Ronewa Mabalane, blew the half-time whistle. Black Mambas replaced Khathutshelo Nduhuni with Mashudu Mamone early in the last half. That prompted the Brothers’ technical staff to introduce Azwidiwi Makharamedzha and Ampfarisaho Muofhe for Vhonani Nemataheni Wavhudi Madzivhandila respectively. Black Mambas fought back via Shonisani Raphalalani 12 minutes towards the end of the game. The score was 1-1 at the end of the regulation time and the game went straight to penalty shootout without adding extra time. Black Mambas converted two of their five chances through Talifhani Masiavhula and Gavin Ralahloko, while United Brothers failed to score even one from the white spot.
