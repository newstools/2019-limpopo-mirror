The Queen of Afropop, Ndivhudzannyi Ralivhona, better known as Makhadzi to her legion of fans, has been releasing singles almost every month and featuring on other artists' works ever since the release of her latest album late last year. However, of all the singles, the stand-out anthem has been the hit Zwigevhenga, which has just come out recently. Zwigevhenga literally translates into 'criminals'. The song is about either person telling their sad story about the love that has slipped through their fingers, so that they are left with nothing but a whiff of air about them. “Zwigevhenga is an alert to both males and females that love is hard to find,” Makhadzi said. “Sometimes you meet criminals of love who will show real love at face value and you'll only discover later on in life that they were only pretending to love you. By that time, you have bonded with them and then they either leave you or you leave them, and you are left heartbroken.” Just like with her previous anthems, entitled Tshanda iya and Magodobo, the strength of Makhadzi's Zwigevhenga does not only lie on the meaningful lyrics, but the upbeat tempo that is created through the harmonious instruments. “I am working on my seventh album, which is a double disk,” she said. “Disk 1 is manyalo songs, and the second is house and fusions of Afropop. This project will come out in August.” The manager at Rita Dee Entertainment, Rita Dee, said that they were looking forward to hosting a fill-up stadium event that has provisionally been scheduled for 3 September at Makhuvha Stadium. “This will be a mega-event and we are calling it Zwahashu na Makhadzi,” Rita Dee said. “This is another way of celebrating the talent that is Makhadzi.” Makhadzi's quality musical output and hard work have elevated her to the status of Queen of Afropop. Makhadzi is also available on Facebook and can be reached via Rita Dee Entertainment on 082 066 6533.
