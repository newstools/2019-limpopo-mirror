After testing their strength against Orlando Pirates at the Orlando Stadium on Wednesday evening, Black Leopards are gearing up for another tough Absa Premiership League match tomorrow afternoon. They will host Kaizer Chiefs at the Thohoyandou Stadium. The fact that Leopards are not on the safe side when it comes to relegation is reason for Lidoda Duvha not to spare any effort in their preparations for the all-important fixture. The Thohoyandou side are in the 12th position on the log, while the Amakhosi are in the seventh spot. Leopards will have only themselves to blame if they fail to collect the maximum points against Chiefs tomorrow. According to Mr Elijah Mulaudzi, Leopards’ general manager, all their players, including Isaac Masia and Khuliso Mudau, will be available for selection tomorrow. Masia and Mudau watched the team’s game against Polokwane City at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium from the grandstand. They were still serving their suspensions. Chiefs’ defenders will have it tough against the Leopards’ strikers, Mwape Musonda, Lifa Hlongwane and Joseph Mhlongo. On the other hand, the Chiefs’ forwards, Bernard Parker and Khama Billiat, will have to double their efforts if they are serious about breaking the Leopards’ defence wall, which is marshaled by Marks Munyai, Pentjie Zulu and the skipper, Jean Munganga. Mulaudzi appealed to the fans to buy their admission tickets in time, saying no tickets would be sold at the stadium. According to him the tickets have been available at Computicket from Monday. Highlands Park will host Maritzburg United at the Makhulong Stadium in Thembisa, while Orlando Pirates and Free State Stars will meet at the Orlando Stadium. The other fixtures are: Polokwane City vs SuperSport United, Bloemfontein Celtic vs Cape Town City and Lamontville Golden Arrows vs Amazulu.
