The much-awaited NFD League match between Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) and TS Sporting will be staged at the Thohoyandou Stadium tomorrow afternoon (Saturday). While Sporting have only pride at stake in the match, the situation is totally different for Vhadau Vha Damani. Sporting are in the ninth position on the log standings with 35 points. They will not qualify for the promotional playoffs, even if they win all three their remaining matches. On the other hand, TTM must collect the maximum points at all costs to remain in the race for the promotional playoffs. TTM are in the fifth spot on the log with 44 points, three short of the promotional playoffs zone. The spirit is high in the TTM camp. They scored 11 goals in their last four games. They did the unexpected last Sunday when they brutally walloped Joel Masutha’s Maccabi FC 3-0 at the Dobsonville Stadium in Johannesburg. Their scoring machine, Phulemelele “Ace” Bhengu, scored five goals in their last two games. He scored a hat trick against Ubuntu Cape Town two weeks ago and scored a brace in their game against Maccabi last Sunday. Bhengu’s combination with Ndabayithethwa Ndlodlo and Nhlanhla Mgaga is expected to give the Sporting defence a headache. The other match that has the potential to attract a huge number of spectators will be between Royal Eagles and Ajax Cape Town at the Chatsworth Stadium in Durban. The other fixtures are: University of Pretoria vs Jomo Cosmos, Uthongathi FC vs Cape Umoya United, Ubuntu Cape Town vs Witbank Spurs, Richards Bay FC vs Maccabi FC, Mbombela United vs Real Kings and Stellenbosch FC vs TS Galaxy.
