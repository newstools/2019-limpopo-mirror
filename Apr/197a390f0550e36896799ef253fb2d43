The local traditional leader at Tshino in the Vuwani area, Chief Tshiwela Mulungwa, has urged staff at the Tshino Clinic to continue providing good service to his community. Mulungwa was addressing staff at the clinic during a function to acknowledge the good work the nurses were doing at the clinic. During the occasion, an initiative by the Tshino Clinic Committee, 13 new nurses were awarded certificates. For a long time, the clinic has been in the news for failing to provide proper service to the disadvantaged rural community during the night. An outcry by the community led to the transfer of the previous nursing staff, but the service has changed considerably after the arrival of the new staff. Tshino Clinic Committee chairperson Mr Ndivhaleni Munyai said that they felt they would not be doing justice by keeping quiet as if nothing good was happening at their clinic. “This is a way of motivating staff here, and we have come up with a programme to empower the staff. Soon we will be offering basic computer literacy courses for home-based carers and we will gather in this fashion from time to time and celebrate excellence. We are also doing this to acknowledge the good work the new nurses are doing here.” Speaking at the function, Chief Tshiwela Mulungwa said they were satisfied with the service the staff were rendering in his community. "We are very happy as a community. We have witnessed a tremendous improvement in services since you arrived in this community. We had problems here where the patients had to wait until the following day to be treated, but this has changed completely,” he said.
