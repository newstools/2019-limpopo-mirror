This weekend marks the end of the programme for the Limpopo Stream of the ABC Motsepe League for the current season. The only two Vhembe-based sides, Tshakhuma RO Nandilani (TRON) and Mikhado FC, will wrap up their programmes at home. TRON will entertain Ndengeza FC at the Tshisaulu Mmbengeni Kone Sport Field tomorrow afternoon. TRON must collect the maximum points in the match in order to avoid relegation. The Tshakhuma side are currently in the 13th spot with 28 points, three ahead of the tail-enders, Polokwane City Academy. Should TRON fail to collect the maximum points against Ndengeza and the other relegation candidates, Giyani Hotspurs, Polokwane City Academy and Ollesdal FC, win their matches, the pride of Tshakhuma will face the chop. TRON and Ndengeza played to a 4-4 draw in their first-round league match at the Giyani Stadium about five months ago. The TRON strikers, Dakalo “Akonkwo” Nemakonde, Rinae Madzhuta and Oscar Mtshauba, are sharpened to kill while their defenders, Khuliso Phosiwa and Rendani Mukomafhedzi, will ensure that their danger area is clean from the onset to the end. Mikhado are waiting for Polokwane City Academy at the Rabali Stadium. While the match will be a mere formality for Mikhado, Academy must collect full points or else they will face relegation. Mikhado will rely on Khuthadzo Tshikulumela, Rendani Thavhana and Vutomi Ngomana for goals. The pace setters, Madridtas FC, will host Ollesdal FC at the Oscar Mphetha Stadium in Turfloop, and Giyani Hotspurs will travel to Polokwane where they will play against Boyne Tigers at the Boyne Stadium. Pusela City will pay a visit to Ditlou FC at the Groblersdal Stadium and Mighty FC will host The Dolphins at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium. The other fixtures are: Magezi FC vs Barracah Valley and Great North FC vs Polokwane United.
