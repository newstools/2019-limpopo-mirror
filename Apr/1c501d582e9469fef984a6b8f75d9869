After collecting maximum points against Witbank Spurs, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) are geared to deposit more points into their league account when they meet Ubuntu Cape Town at the Thohoyandou Stadium tomorrow. They beat Spurs 2-0 in their NFD League match at the Puma Rugby Stadium in eMalahleni last weekend. The match is expected to attract a huge number of spectators, as the local team must win the match in order to keep their promotional playoff hopes alive. The Tshakhuma side are currently in the sixth position on the log with 38 points, 10 behind the log leaders, Stellenbosch FC, and 5 behind the second-placed Royal Eagles. The team that will be on top of the log at the end of the season will gain automatic promotion to the Absa Premiership Division, while the second- and third-placed sides, together with the Absa Premiership team that will finish in the 15th place, will compete in the promotional playoffs. The best team in the promotional playoffs will also be promoted to the Absa Premiership Division. Ubuntu Cape Town are fighting for survival as they are in the third position from the bottom of the log. The club’s marketing manager, Mr Livhuwani Madzuhe, said that all the players are razor sharp. He stated that the combination of Edward Maqele, Phumelele Bhengu and Wonderboy Makhubu at the forefront can worry the defence of Ubuntu from the onset to the end. Madzuhe said that entrance to the stadium will be free tomorrow. Joel Masutha’s Maccabi FC will host the other title chasers, Royal Eagles, at the Dobsonville Stadium. The other weekend fixtures are: Ajax Cape Town vs Witbank Spurs, Mbombela United vs Uthongathi FC, Jomo Cosmos vs Stellenbosch FC, Richards Bay FC vs Real Kings, University of Pretoria vs TS Galaxy and Cape Umoya United vs TS Sporting.
