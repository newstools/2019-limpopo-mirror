Black Leopards’ 1-3 loss to Polokwane City in their Absa Premiership League match at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium seems to have far-reaching implications regarding the future of the club as an affiliate of the country’s elite division. Although Lidoda Duvha did not move an inch on the log after the defeat, teams below them won their matches last weekend, piling huge pressure onto Leopards. Maritzburg United, who are fighting for survival at the bottom of the log, did the unexpected when they crushed Bloemfontein Celtics 2-1 last Friday. The other relegation candidates, Chippa United and Baroka FC, both won 1-0 over Amazulu and Kaizer Chiefs respectively. Following last weekend's results, Maritzburg United have 20 points while Free State Stars, Baroka FC and Chippa United have each deposited 24 points into their league accounts while Leopards have 25 (the result for Wednesday's match between Leopards vs Orlando Pirates not included). A quick glance at Leopards’ remaining fixtures reveals that the local lads have Mount Kilimanjaro to climb. They will host Kaizer Chiefs at the Thohoyandou Stadium tomorrow (Saturday) afternoon. They still must play Mamelodi Sundowns at home and away. Lidoda Duvha’s other remaining fixtures are Bidvest Wits (away), Maritzburg United (home), Amazulu (away) and Cape Town City (home). Leopards must win at least three of their remaining fixtures to be safe when it comes to relegation. Leopards were the first to draw blood in their game against Polokwane City last Sunday. Mwape Musonda, the league’s top goal scorer, headed home in the 27th minute. The home side found the equalizer through Puleng Tlolane on the stroke of half time. Leopards lost shape in the middle of park for the better part of the last half. City took the lead via Mpho Mvelase, while the third one came via Mohammed Anas later in the game. City’s captain, Jabulani Maluleke, was the Man of the Match.
