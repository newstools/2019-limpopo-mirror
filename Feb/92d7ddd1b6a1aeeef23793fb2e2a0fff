Outspoken trade unionist and senior member of the South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) in Limpopo Mr Timmy Tshililo Musetsho (48) who survived a shooting incident last week, has succumbed to his injuries. The family confirmed that he passed on last night after being admitted to a hospital in Polokwane. Musetsho was at the forefront of calls for the removal of all Vhembe District Municipality (VDM) officials involved in the loss of the more than R300 million belonging to the VDM, which was invested with the liquidated VBS Mutual Bank. He was also very vocal about corruption taking place in Vhembe. He was shot last Thursday when he arrived at his home at Makwarela by a lone gunman who fled the scene after the shooting. He was taken to hospital where he was recuperating. Musetsho's death follows on the heels of the death of yet another fearless trade unionist, Mr Ronald Mani, deputy secretary of SAMWU Limpopo. Mani was shot execution style after enjoying drinks with friends at Itsani outside Thohoyandou. He too has been very vocal about corruption at Vhembe district municipality and the VBS saga. Limpopo police commissioner Gen Nneke has established a high-powered task team that will probe the killings in Vhembe. * Limpopo Mirror will follow the story as it develops and will inform our readers as it unfolds.
