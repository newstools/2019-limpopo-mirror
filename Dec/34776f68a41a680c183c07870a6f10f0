After kissing the Nedbank Cup KO competition goodbye at the Thohoyandou Stadium last weekend, following their 3-4 defeat at the hands of Uthongathi FC, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) are now fully focused on the league title. According to the team’s caretaker coach, Mr Lucky “Mchichwa” Nelukau, they regard the defeat to Uthongathi as water under the bridge. Mr Nelukau said that although the defeat was an embarrassment to both the players and management, he regarded it as a blessing in disguise. He further indicated that staying in the Nedbank Cup would divide their attention. TTM, or Vhadau Vha Damani as they are affectionately called, will host Free State Stars in their GladAfrica Championship League match at the Thohoyandou Stadium on Sunday. Asked about the team’s level of readiness for the game, Mr Nelukau revealed that the team was ready to absorb the heat from the former Absa Premiership side. According to him, the only player who is a doubtful starter is Tshepo Makgoga. Makgoga was taken off the pitch on a stretcher with a pulled muscle in their game against Uthongathi last Sunday. Should Makgoga not be available for selection on Sunday, the former Black Leopards skipper, Jean Munganga, is likely to be the placeholder. Ajax Cape Town will host JDR Stars at the Cape Town Stadium. Mbombela United will host Real Kings at the Kanyamazane Stadium in Nelspruit. The KZN derby between Royal Eagles and Richards Bay FC will be staged at the Harry Gwala Stadium in Pietermaritzburg. Swallows FC will fight for league points with University of Pretoria at the Volkswagen Dobsonville Stadium. TS Sporting will rub shoulders with Cape Umoya United at the Kabokweni Stadium outside Nelspruit. The pace setters, Uthongathi FC, will pay a visit to TS Galaxy at the Kameelrivier Stadium in Siyabuswa. Jomo Cosmos will play against Steenberg United at the Vosloorus Stadium.
