Community members, family and church members came in large numbers to pay tribute to Ms Johanna Mugwena (62), who was buried at Mbaleni Cemetery on Saturday, 23 November. The service was held at Tsianda Faithful Church of God. Mugwena died three weeks ago at her home at Tsianda after a short illness. All the speakers recognized the good work that Mugwena had done for the community as a leader and Christian. A family representative, Mr Avhapfani Mugwena, told the mourners that the family had accepted the loss although it was difficult to cope with. “The pain we experience as a family is more than words can express,” said Mugwena. Bishop Azwindini Siala from the Faithful Church of God said that her death had robbed the community of an energetic leader who had been full of zeal and courage. He said Mugwena would always be remembered for being the driver of opportunities within the communities where she had lived. “She will be remembered for her dedication and commitment to the church and for her vision,” he said.
