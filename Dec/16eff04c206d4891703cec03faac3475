Now that Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) are out of the Nedbank Cup KO competition, Black Leopards are the only hope for local football lovers in the annual event. TTM lost 3-4 to Uthongathi FC at the Thohoyandou Stadium last Sunday. Asked to comment after the humiliating defeat, Mr Lucky “Mchichwa” Nelukau, the team’s caretaker coach, described the result of the match as a bitter pill to swallow for him. He stated that their aim had been to do better than what they had achieved last season. Vhadau Vha Damani were booted out of the competition by the Absa Premiership side, Chippa United, in the last-16 stage last season. They beat them 2-0 at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth. Although his team lost the match, Mr Nelukau was singing the praises of his players after the final whistle. He indicated that the boys had done everything right from the start to the bitter and that the visitors from Durban had been lucky to snatch the winning goal just a minute before the referee, Mr Michael Mosemeng, had blown the final whistle. Mr Nelukau reiterated that their primary focus will be on the league title now that their Nedbank Cup road has come to an end. Mr John Ferreira, the head coach of Uthongathi FC, was quick to mention that they were lucky to come out of the Thohoyandou Stadium alive. According to him, TTM deserved to win the match as they had enjoyed ball possession for the better part of the game. TTM were trailing 0-2 at some stage, but they did not throw in the towel. They took the game to the visitors after introducing Tommy Mandlazi and Phumelele Bhengu for Nhlanhla Mgaga and Wonderboy Makhubu respectively. Mboniseni Mbandlwa scored the first goal while the team’s captain, Carlington Nyadombo, netted the equalizer. TTM took the lead in the first half of extra time, but their celebrations were cut short as Uthongathi scored two goals in quick succession in the dying minutes of the game.
