The Malamulele-born midfielder for Polokwane City football club, Themba Chauke, says young people must focus on sport in order to stay away from social ills such as crime, alcohol and drug  abuse. “Sport can make them responsible people who are in charge of their future,” he says. “Every time I go to the villages, I see young people abusing drugs and alcohol because they don't have anything that keeps them busy and it is really bad. I would like to encourage them to focus on soccer in order to beat these social ills. I was once there in the villages, and if I managed to make it, you can also make it in life, despite your surroundings and family background.” The 26-year-old Chauke started playing soccer in the dusty streets of Dinga Village in Malamulele. He previously played for amateur sides such as Bilika All Stars, Tsunami FC and Mmaila Citizens. He also played for Tshakuma Tsha Madivhandila FC and The Dolphins FC. “I want to see myself playing for the national team and overseas, as it is every player’s dream,” he says. The mayor of Collins Chabane local municipality, Moses Maluleke, has applauded Themba Chauke for representing the municipality in the Premier Soccer League. He urged other young stars to follow in his footsteps. “As the municipality, we are very proud of him and call for other young people to participate in sports,” Maluleke said.
