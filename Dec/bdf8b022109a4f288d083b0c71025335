The Multichoice Diski Challenge Black Leopards lost 1-3 to Bloemfontein Celtic at the Dr Molemela Stadium in Bloemfontein last Sunday. They can register the first victory for the season when they rub shoulders with Orlando Pirates at the Kanyamazane Stadium in Nelspruit on Sunday afternoon. Time is fast running out for the young Lidoda Duvha. They are currently at the bottom of the log with only 6 points from 17 matches. The Thohoyandou outfit are still to win a league match to date. Their best results were when they played to a draw on six occasions. Orlando Pirates have nothing much at stake in the match. They are currently lying in the middle of the log. Leopards will pin their hopes for goals on players such as Tiklas Thutlwa, Selby Rapatsas, Siyabonga Hlabisa and Amukelani Chauke. Mr Mongezi Bobe, the Leopards’ head coach, has been quoted on numerous occasions as saying his side would make a comeback to start collecting the much-needed points, but that was not to be. In other matches that will also be played on Sunday, Bidvest Wits will meet SuperSport United at the same venue. The KZN derby between Amazulu and Maritzburg United will be staged at the King Zwelithini Stadium in Durban. Lamontville Golden Arrows will host Bloemfontein Celtic at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium in Durban. In the two matches that will be played next Monday, 16 December, Baroka FC will entertain Mamelodi Sundowns at the Kanyamazane Stadium, while Kaizer Chiefs and Polokwane City will fight for league points at the same venue later in the afternoon. Tomorrow’ fixtures are: Chippa United vs Stellenbosch and Highlands Park vs Cape Town City.
