Fans of Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) will have to wait and see if they prove all the critics wrong and make a comeback when they host the University of Pretoria in their GladAfrica Championship League match at the Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday afternoon. TTM, or Vhadau Vha Damani, are still in shock after suffering a 1-3 defeat at the hands of TS Galaxy at the Kameelrivier Stadium in Siyabuswa on Monday afternoon. This defeat was the third in a row for TTM. They lost 3-4 to Uthongathi FC in their Nedbank Cup match and gave away league points to Free State Stars with a 0-2 defeat before travelling to Siyabuswa on Monday. Tomorrow’s match will be the second for TTM under the guidance of the team’s new head coach, Mr Vladislav Heric. The Serbian national was on the team’s technical bench for the first time in their game against TS Galaxy on Monday. TTM will be without the team’s right back, Lucios Ndou, tomorrow. Ndou was given his marching orders in their game against Free State Stars at the Thohoyandou Stadium two weeks ago. The likes of Lebohang Mabotja, Carlington Nyadombo and Tshepo Makgoga will be expected to do the job in the absence of Ndou. The TTM midfielders, Philip Ndlondlo, Nhlanhla Mgaga and Mboniseni Mbandla, will give the defenders of Amatuks a headache if not well contained. TTM and Amatuks are closely contesting for the league championship. TTM are in the seventh position while Amatuks are third on the log standings. The match of the week will be between JDR Stars and Uthongathi FC at the Soshanguve Giant Stadium outside Pretoria. Mbombela United will host Swallows FC at the Kanyamazane Stadium in Nelspruit. The other fixtures are Ajax Cape Town vs Jomo Cosmos, TS Sporting vs TS Galaxy, Royal Eagles vs Free State Stars and Richards Bay vs Steenberg United and Cape Umoya United vs Real Kings.
