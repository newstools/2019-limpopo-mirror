They collected four points in their last two league matches, and now Black Leopards are determined to collect full points in their Absa Premiership League match against Orlando Pirates at the Orlando Stadium in Johannesburg tomorrow (Saturday) afternoon. Leopards and Pirates are closely contesting for a top-eight place. The Buccaneers are in the seventh position with 17 points, while the Thohoyandou outfit are in the10th spot with 16 points. Should his work permit be ready, the new Orlando Pirates head coach, Mr Josef Zinnbauer, will be on the team’s technical bench for the first time tomorrow. The German national was appointed last week, taking over from Mr Rhulani Mokoena, who has been the team’s caretaker coach from the beginning of the season. Should they manage to maul the Buccaneers tomorrow, Lidoda Duvha are likely to jump from the 10th to the sixth spot. After watching his teammates display their skills from the grandstand for several matches, the Leopards’ forward, Lifa Hlongwane, is likely to be part of the team that will travel to Johannesburg tomorrow. Should he be given the chance, Hlongwane’s combination with Mwape Musonda and Joseph Mhlongo will give the Pirates’ defence a run for their money. The Pirates strikers will have to double their efforts to find their way through the Leopards’ defenders, Abel Zulu, Chris Katjiukua and Edwin Gyimah. Leopards’ performance improved dramatically, following the appointment of Mr Luc Eymael as the team’s head coach two months ago. Highlands Park will entertain Lamontville Golden Arrows at the Makhulong Stadium in Thembisa. The rookies, Stellenbosch FC, will visit Baroka FC at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane. The other weekend fixtures are: Mamelodi Sundowns vs Polokwane City, Chippa United vs SuperSport United, Bloemfontein Celtic vs Amazulu, Maritzburg United vs Kaizer Chiefs and Bidvest Wits vs Cape Town City.
